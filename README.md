**All about Dataset**<br>
This dataset is a CSV of facial images that are labeled on the basis of age, gender, and ethnicity. The dataset includes 27305 rows and 5 columns.
In this project I have used this dataset to train and validate deep learning models. As CNNs are best suitable for image processing , so I trained given images with CNN models (Resnet-9 and Resnet-18). I have used data augmentation, batch normalization, learning rate scheduling and some regularization techniques like grad clipping, dropout.
